# Writer's Assistant

There are tons of great apps for novel writers. Unfortunately, they don't work with my native language.
I decided to write my own tool to aid with the creation process in the Lithuanian language.

This app features:
1. Breakdown of all chapters: word count, scene count, characters mentioned
2. Fast search for mentions of words and names, including different declensions 
3. Keeping track of characters, first and last mentions
4. Ability to tag each scene with specific topics mentioned, search by tags
5. Auto generated character portraits
