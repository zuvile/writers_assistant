# Writer's Assistant

In my spare time, I like to write fantasy novels. There are a ton of great tools for writers already, however none of them work in my native language.
They also tend to have costly subscription plans.
This backend is written in python using the Django framework and the frontend is written in React.
I utilised openAI api to generate character portraits and have an AI assistant beta reader to help writer's with their novels.


This app features:
1. In app view of the entire novel, each chapter with word count
2. Ability to add characters and generate character portraits using openAI
3. An AI assistant beta reader that has read the novel and can chat about it
